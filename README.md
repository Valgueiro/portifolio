# portifolio

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.
A short introduction of this app could easily go here.

# TODO List

I'll keep here something like a requirements page and I'll also put any ideas that appears on my mind.

* Use ember octane
* Github workflows (anyone that automatically deploys on gh-pages the builded bundle)
* Enable Dependabot
* Create an area for useful things like a Web Cam and Mic testing page.
